FirstName : **Daehan** <br/>
LastName : **Choi** <br/>
NickName : **VitaMax**

### WHO AM I ?
Currently working for a start-up company, [`Try { catch }`](https://www.trycatch.kr/) in the Seoul Metropolitan area of South Korea. <br/>
Hoping to connect with other like-minded individuals. <br/>
I have a lot of interest in programming, ranging from `Computer science`(such as Data structure), `Operating system`(Linux) and `Programming languages` (such as Java, Kotlin and so forth). <br/>
I am a quite extroverted person so it can benefit me in the workplace to create a positive atmosphere as a team member. <br/>
In my free time, I often study because I am very self-motivated to improve my skills and learn more about things related to programming concepts.
